# Real-Time FPGA/ASIC Solar Flare Detection for CubeSats  
**NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 Project**  

This project presents a real-time solar flare detection system designed for CubeSats using FPGA/ASIC technology. It aims to improve CubeSat resilience and autonomy by detecting solar flares onboard, reducing reliance on delayed data from traditional observatory satellites.

## Problem Statement
Solar flares can disrupt satellite operations and communications. Observatories like SOHO and GOES provide solar flare data, but there is a delay in transmitting this information to satellites. CubeSats, due to their limited resources, cannot react in real time to solar flare events, making them vulnerable to radiation damage.

## Our Solution
We developed a real-time solar flare detection system that can be integrated directly into CubeSats:  
- **FPGA/ASIC-Based:** Implements the detection algorithm directly on hardware for high-speed processing.  
- **Onboard Detection:** Allows CubeSats to autonomously identify solar flare events in real time.  
- **Prototype:** Built and tested on the **Digilent Nexys A7 FPGA** board.  

This solution enables CubeSats to take immediate protective actions, improving mission reliability and longevity.
